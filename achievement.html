                Education is not just schooling. Neither is it mere literacy. Education is empowerment. It is providing individuals the tools to understand the world they are living in – the many forces, man-made or otherwise that shape their everyday lives. It is creating awareness of their rights and privileges. It is providing them an ability to stand up for those.
                
                <p>1. The popular acceptance and practice of `Gram Kosh’ (villagers’ own fund through fixed monthly contributions and its development as a revolving fund for the benefit of the members ) in all these villages has been a major achievement for the organisation particularly in terms of its enabling capacity for self-help. </p>

<p>2. MEDHA  leadership development initiatives at the community level have led to the Lok Shakti Sangathan being instrumental in the formation of 1039 SHGs in the districts of Madhubani Saharsa , Supaul and Darbhanga
                </p>
 
 <P>3. Deeply committed to the cause of environmental regeneration and ecological sustainability, the organization has not stayed content with laying claim to land and water resources but has gone beyond to the regeneration of these often degraded  resources through shramdan (voluntary contribution of labour).  Land and pond user committees of the poor have been set up for productive and sustainable management of land and water resources brought under control. These committees have helped in regeneration conservation, construction and innovative use of the assets that were mostly acquired in a highly degraded state.</P>     
 
 <P>4. MEDHA achievement of the organisation has been in the area of primary education. A major thrust of the organisation here has been the setting up of NFE centres to kindle the interest of the target group children in education and motivation of their wards about the significance of education with the eventual aim of enrolling the children in the formal education system. With support from Swiss Red Cross the organisation had been running 20 NFE centres in 20 villages. A survey conducted in these 20 villages in 2001 found that 656 children of the eligible age group from the target group were still not attending any school. A major drive for their enrollment either in government schools or NFE centres eventually led to the number of non school going children coming down to 150 from 656 by March 2003. The organisation has also backed up its efforts of enrollment in government schools by ensuring that the various governmental schemes, like scholarships, incentives and nutrition support, targetted at the underprivileged children actually reach them. Community representatives regularly monitor these schemes. These efforts have helped bring down the drop out rate of target group children from the government schools. A survey conducted in the government schools in and around the aforementioned 20 villages found that of a total of 4339 children enrolled in these schools, 822 came from the dalit community. The CBOs are being regularly motivated by the organisation to petition the relevant authorities for improving student teacher ratio and to look into the absence of teachers from government schools.  An NFE initiative along similar lines was carried out in 35 villages of Saharsa district with support from ActionAid, India.  As part of the ActionAid supportive initiative, an innovative approach called `REFLECT’ was adopted for running adult literacy classes.  Reflect is an innovative approach to adult learning and social change, which fuses the theories of Paulo Freire with the methodologies of participatory rural appraisal. Originally developed in pilot projects in Bangladesh, El Salvador and Uganda between 1993-95, Reflect is now used by over 500 organisations in around 70 countries worldwide.</P>

The right to an education is vital for the economic, social and cultural development of all societies.</b>
              Education entails that its subjects acquire a variety of knowledge. It begins with the acquisition of elementary knowledge—that is to say, literacy—on the part of the youngest members of society. At this stage, children learn to read and write thanks to primary instruction and parental oversight.

This is an essential stage which will permit the child to pursue his/her education by integrating secondary and post-secondary instruction.

Education also consists of a form of learning that is necessary for the development of one’s personality and identity, as well as his physical and intellectual capabilities. Education permits, notably, the transmission of common principles to new generations, and the conservation and perpetuation of social values. It also contributes to the flourishing of individuality through the enhancement of social and professional integration</p>
